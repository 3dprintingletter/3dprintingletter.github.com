Hi!

I finally did what I planned to do a long time ago, create a 3D Printing blog to support my weekly [3D Printing newsletter](http://www.3dprintingletter.com/). This blog is a permanent work in progress. The main purpose is not necessarily to provide 3D Printing news (that's already done by many other blogs, websites and my own 3D printing newsletter). So you might ask what this blog will be about then. Well, the short answer is we'll see. The slightly longer answer is:

+ Interviews with 3D printing pioneers
+ Hands-on 3D Printers
+ Original articles about 3D Printing that have not been reported by news outlets

You'll hear from me. Cheers!
